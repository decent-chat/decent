## await client.connectTo(hostname: string)
Attempts to connect to the Decent server at `hostname`. Returns a Promise that resolves once it has connected succesfully. Always call this before doing anything else.

Will reject if the server at `hostname` is unreachable or decent.js and it have different major version numbers (ie. incompatible).

## await client.register(username: string, password: string)
Creates a new users, resolving with the new [User](user.md). Fails if the username is taken, invalid, or the password is too short (typically < 6 characters is rejected).

## await client.login(username: string, password: string)
Attempts to log in using the provided credentials. Resolves with the newly logged-in [user](user.md).

## await client.loginWithSessionID(sessionID: string)
Attempts to log in using the provided sessionID. Resolves with the newly logged-in [user](user.md).

## await client.logout(deleteSessionID: boolean)
Logs out. `deleteSessionID` defaults to true, but you might want to set it to false if you're planning to use `client.loginWithSessionID` later.

## await client.getMessageByID(id: string)
Finds and resolves with the [message](message.md) with ID `id`.

## await client.setServerName(name: string)
Attempts to change the server's name (`client.serverName`).
