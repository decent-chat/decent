## user.toString()
Returns the identifying \@mention string for this user. For example:

await channel.sendMessage(`Welcome, ${user}!`) // @mentions the user
```

Note that just sending `@username` will not work to actually mention a user.

## _not implemented_ await user.getMentions()
Resolves with an instance of [UserMentions](user-mentions.md) for this user.

## await user.getPermissions()
Resolves with an object mapping permission names to true/false values.
